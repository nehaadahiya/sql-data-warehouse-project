## üîÑ Data Flow Explanation

1. **Data Ingestion (Bronze):** Raw CSV files from ERP and CRM systems are imported into the SQL Server staging schema without modifications.
2. **Data Transformation (Silver):** Data is cleaned, standardized (e.g., resolving duplicates, normalizing codes), and integrated into consolidated tables.
3. **Data Modeling (Gold):** Data is loaded into star schema tables, ready for analytical queries and reporting.

This structured flow ensures traceability, scalability, and clear data lineage.
