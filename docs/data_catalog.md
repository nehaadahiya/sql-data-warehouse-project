# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** repository.  
This project demonstrates the end-to-end development of a modern data warehouse using SQL Server, designed to enable actionable business insights through robust data modeling and analytics.

---

## üìñ Project Overview

This repository showcases:

- **Data Architecture:** Follows a multi-layered Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold).
- **ETL Pipelines:** Ingest, cleanse, and transform data using SQL scripts.
- **Data Modeling:** Implements a star schema for simplified, performant analytics.
- **Analytics & Reporting:** Enables key business insights using SQL-based analyses.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Data Architecture

The warehouse is structured as follows:

- **Bronze Layer:** Raw data from ERP and CRM systems ingested as-is (CSV format).
- **Silver Layer:** Cleansed, standardized, and integrated data ready for modeling.
- **Gold Layer:** Business-ready, analytics-optimized data modeled using a star schema.

---

## ‚ú® Star Schema Overview

The star schema in the Gold Layer simplifies analytical queries and supports business reporting. It consists of:

- **Fact Table:** `fact_sales` (stores transactional sales data).
- **Dimension Tables:** `dim_customers`, `dim_products`.

This design reduces query complexity and improves performance, allowing for faster and more intuitive data exploration.

## üìÑ Data Catalog ‚Äî Gold Layer

The Gold Layer represents the final, business-facing data model. It enables comprehensive reporting and supports advanced analytics.

## üîÑ Data Flow Explanation

1. **Data Ingestion (Bronze):** Raw CSV files from ERP and CRM systems are imported into the SQL Server staging schema without modifications.
2. **Data Transformation (Silver):** Data is cleaned, standardized (e.g., resolving duplicates, normalizing codes), and integrated into consolidated tables.
3. **Data Modeling (Gold):** Data is loaded into star schema tables, ready for analytical queries and reporting.

This structured flow ensures traceability, scalability, and clear data lineage.

## üí¨ Example SQL Queries

Below are sample SQL queries stakeholders might use to generate insights:

```sql
-- Top-selling products
SELECT 
    dp.product_name,
    SUM(fs.sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM gold.fact_sales fs
JOIN gold.dim_products dp ON fs.product_key = dp.product_key
GROUP BY dp.product_name
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;

-- Customer purchase behavior
SELECT 
    dc.country,
    COUNT(DISTINCT fs.customer_key) AS unique_customers,
    SUM(fs.sales_amount) AS total_revenue
FROM gold.fact_sales fs
JOIN gold.dim_customers dc ON fs.customer_key = dc.customer_key
GROUP BY dc.country
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

-- Monthly sales trend
SELECT 
    FORMAT(order_date, 'yyyy-MM') AS sales_month,
    SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM gold.fact_sales
GROUP BY FORMAT(order_date, 'yyyy-MM')
ORDER BY sales_month;
