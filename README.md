## 🏗️ Data Architecture

This project follows the **Medallion Architecture**, structured into three layers:

- **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data ingested directly from ERP and CRM CSV files into the SQL Server database.
- **Silver Layer**: Cleansed, standardized, and normalized data prepared for analysis.
- **Gold Layer**: Business-ready, analytics-optimized data modeled in a star schema for reporting and insights.
